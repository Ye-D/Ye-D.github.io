I am Ye Dong (董业), a Ph.D. student at IIE, CAS under [Prof. Xiaojun Chen](http://people.ucas.ac.cn/~0040771). I mainly focus on privacy-preserving machine learning, including secure multi-party computation, homomorphic encryption, distributed machine learning, and federated learning. I got my bachelor degree in School of Computer Science and Technology, Shandong University. I had been one Research Assistant at [NETWORK & INFORMATION SECURITY LAB](http://www.isec.sdu.edu.cn/sysgk.htm) under [Prof. Qiuliang Xu](https://www.sc.sdu.edu.cn/info/1045/1736.htm).
