Abstract: With the development of human genomes sequencing technology, the biological and medical research has been greatly accelerated and a wide range of health-related applications and services become more and more ubiquitous and affordable. However, the digitized genomes sequence raises serious privacy issues since a genome contains individual's extremely sensitive information. In this paper, we mainly focus on efficient and privacy-preserving set intersection protocol of human genomes. It makes the paternity and ancestry testing perform safely, without disclosing any additional individual's genomic information. Experimental results demonstrate that proposed techniques have better performance.
